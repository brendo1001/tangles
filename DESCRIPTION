Description: 
  Tools for anonymising spatial datasets while preserving spatial structure and relationships. 
  Original coordinates or raster geometries are transformed using randomized or predefined 
  sequences of vertical shifts, horizontal shifts, and rotations. Compatible with point-based 
  data in matrix, data.frame, or sf format, as well as terra raster objects. Supports reversible 
  anonymisation workflows, hash-based validation, shapefile export, and consistent tangling across 
  related datasets using stored transformation sequences.
