## CRAN RESPONSE
Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace (including the package directory and getwd()). That is not allow by CRAN policies. 

Please only write/save files if the user has specified a directory in the function themselves!
In your examples/vignettes/tests you can write to tempdir().

The codelines in most of your examples are commented out.
Please NEVER do that! Ideally find toy examples that can be regularly executed and checked. Lengthy examples (> 5 sec), can be wrapped in \donttest{}.

Please fix and resubmit.

There are examples in comments in HV_subsoilpH.Rd Please either omit comments or examples.

Please always make sure to reset to user's options, wd or par after you changed it in examples and vignettes.
e.g.: vignette
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(1,2))
...
par(oldpar)
