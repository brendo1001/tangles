## Introduction
This demo provides some context and use cases of the three functions that make up the *tangles* R package. 


```{r libraries, echo=T, eval= T, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(tangles);library(digest);library(raster);library(sp)
```


## Getting data from SLGA

The function *getSLGA_data* retrieves SLGA data. It is designed to extract: organic carbon (%), soil texture fractions (sand, silt, and clay), and bulk density (kg/m3). Data is extracts for all depth internals to 1m. The function requires a vector of coordinates representing to point location (longitude and latitude) where data is retrieved from. It also requires a folder directory, as the function physically downloads raster data before extraction of the data at the given point location.
